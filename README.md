Maitre-corbeaux.com
===================

Maitre-corbeaux.com is my personal website project. It will centralize my personal activities of development and my technological watch, my professional profile... and maybe later some other projects.

The site is powered by Zend Framework and will be entirely open-source.

Installation and requirements
-----------------------------

The project simply needs PHP 5.3 and the Zend Framework 1.11.4 to be in the PHP's include path or in the library dir.

For obvious reasons privates data, like ReCAPTCHA's keys and DB access, aren't versionned.
For the application to work, you need to move /application/configs/application.sample.ini to /application/configs/application.ini, and configure it.
